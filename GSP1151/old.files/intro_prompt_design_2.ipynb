      "The sky is blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This is the scattering of light by particles that are smaller than the wavelength of light. In the case of the sky, the particles that are doing the scattering are molecules of nitrogen and oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "When sunlight hits these molecules, the blue light is scattered more than the other colors. This is because the blue light has a shorter wavelength than the other colors. The red light, orange light, and yellow light are not scattered as much, so they travel through the atmosphere to our eyes. This is why we see the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of scattering depends on the wavelength of light and the size of the particles. The shorter the wavelength of light, the more it is scattered. The smaller the particles, the more they scatter light.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why the sky is blue during the day. However, at sunrise and sunset, the sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes. This means that more of the blue light is scattered, and we see the sky as more red or orange.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sky can also appear blue when there is a lot of dust or pollution in the air. This is because the dust and pollution particles act as additional scattering particles.\n",

Google Apps Scritp - beginning! (March 2020)
March 8, 2020 - This repository the 'official' start - I am clarifying my objectives for the time-being what I will keep here, but for now they look like this (something to cover 2020-2021 lifespan):
- Learn Google Apps Script (GAS) to the extenet I can automate routine activities I have in my business (I use Gmail so far only)
- Learn GAS to help yo automate routines of the business (I wotk for the consulting shop with 30+ colleagues distributed worldwide and we use G Suite for the buisness, again, I think we use it not enough)
- (Optional) Build the full and automated solution to the business I work with (tbd targets and tasks)
- (Optional) Teach 1-2 trainees who can support / develop further the business solution
- (Optional) Take Goolge certificaes (tbd)
- Slowly go into Javascript as I can manage GAS to the extent I find convenient
- (Optional) Learn other cloud solutions and platforms - Azure anf AWS as interesting options
- (Optional) Learn JS frameworks (tbd)
- (Optional) Learn back-end language(s), Python most likely, PHP or Java as another options
